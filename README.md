# Random-Walk-Simulation - Master-Thesis 

The main goal of this dissertation is
to build a software capable to simulate the path tracking of the persons who are
walking on a cover of IST(Illuminated Smart Tiles) in order to determine the error rate of the sensors that are responsible to detect and follow the exact positions of the personâ€™s feet on the tiles.

## This projects includes seven scripts:

1. simulation.py
2. show_tile.py
3. show_feet.py
4. track.py
5. diffrence.py
6. aggregate.py
7. diffrence_all.py

### simulation.py:
```simulation.py``` should be run before runing the scripts ```show_tile.py```,
```show_foot.py``` and ```track.py```.

```simulation.py``` generates walking data on a random path. 
It gets two names as the parameters and generates two csv files 
with the same names.
For example:
```
python simulation.py "tilesim.csv" "feetsim.csv"
```

### show_tile.py:
```show_tile.py``` gets generated files by ```simulation.py``` that keeps 
information about tiles and its overlap-area between foot and tiles as argument.
It displays the tiles animation.
For example:
```
python show_tile.py "tilesim.csv"
```

### show_feet.py:
```show_feet.py``` gets generated file by ```simulation.py``` that keeps 
information about steps as argument.
It displays the steps animation.
```
python show_feet.py "feetsim.csv"
```

### track.py:
```track.py``` gets two arguments:
1. Generated file by ```simulation.py``` that  keeps 
information about tiles and its overlap-area between foot and tiles.
2. The output file name that keeps estimated feet coordinates.
It estimates feet coordinates(x,y).
For example:
```
python track.py "tilesim.csv" "track.csv"
```

### diffrence.py:
It displays error graph between real foot position and detected foot position.
It gets two files as arguments:
1. The output file that keeps real feet position. It is generated ```simulation.py```.
2. The output file that keeps detected feet position.It is generated by ```track.py```.
```
python diffrence.py "feetsim.csv" "track.csv"
```

### aggregate.py:
It gets two different files which generated by ```simulation.py``` that keeps 
information about tiles and aggregates the weights from two diffrent files into a single file.
Also, It can get output file as third argument.
For example:
```
python aggregate.py "tilesim1.csv" "tilesim2.csv" "output.csv"
```

### diffrence_all.py:
It displays error graph between real foot position and detected foot position for
all existed files in a specific directory.
It gets directory path as arguments:
The script read only files with ```_real.csv``` and ```_detected.csv``` suffixes.
For example:
```
python diffrence_all.py "/Users/FolderName"
```
